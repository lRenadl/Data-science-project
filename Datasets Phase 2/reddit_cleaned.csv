better than black people and are more deserving of going to college my brother told them if they can't recognize their privilege they can figure out how to pay for college originally posted to r relationship_advice trigger warning racism mood spoiler hopeful original post rareddit oct 21 2020 my brother doesn't use reddit so i thought i'd try and get some advice for him these kids were always a bit odd and awkward but we always just chopped that up to being kids we are all very close i see them twice a week about i live in oakland and they live about 10 minutes east of oakland which is a very white suburb the boys said there's 5 black people at their school and they were all recruited to play sports there and they both play football and are teammates with a few of them but it's not like we live in the south or anything they literally repeat shit you see on 4chan are all about qanon and start arguments any time they can i remember being a teenage boy and loved pushing buttons but they will say the most misogynistic homophobic racists stuff and then when i try to talk to them about it they call me a liberal snowflake i try to approach it by asking questions and guiding their thought process saying how would you feel if xyz and they say i wouldn't care cuz i would just work hard or i wouldn't whine about it i've obviously talked to my brother about this privately and he's just at his wits end i suggested he force them to volunteer in oakland or something like that and try to show them how normal people of less privilege are i've always thought if you get exposed to the group you are adverse to you'll realize how similar you both are my brother finally snapped and asked them why they get to go to college and not all the kids at oakland tech and they literally said they're better than them and it's proven to be such and they deserve to go to college more because affirmative action is bullshit mind you they both get mostly c's and a few b's my brother acted out of impulse and told them they can find their own way to pay for college but is sticking to his guns and now the boys won't talk to him and have told me they blame black people for getting their dad to think this way i am shocked by their behavior but feel my brother's decision will just push them further down this path it's ok for them to be republican hell if they were just trump supporters i feel like they could make it work to just avoid certain conversations but it feels like they're steps away from becoming nazi's any advice tl dr nephews have turned into alt right bigots and brother said if they can't recognize their privilege then they do relevant comments caught_up12 tell your brother that he is the man these kids will get a firm reality check in their coming years if they don't change their outlook on life and society sounds like they are headed down a destructive path and fast they are 16 and 14 they need their dad and will soon be begging for his help if he himself doesn't budge if he does they know they can get away with this bs tell him to stand his ground oop that's what i said to him at first like maybe should've threatened something smaller because if he doesn't follow through with this it'll be an empty threat and they won't take him seriously woodit so i assume from the bit about the kids getting recruited to their school for sports that they're in a private school so step one would be send them to public school they'll get worse at first seeing a large sample size with a spectrum of behavior from their peers of color but they'll see it from white kids as well and they'll see plenty of counter examples in the nonwhite kids eventually there will be so many exceptions to their standard view that it will hollow out like a swiss cheese of racist naivety step 2 is no more allowance cars luxuries whatever else he is giving them they want to earn and be better than others cool go get shit jobs in fast food the best route would be to work under managers who are not white i think this is better than volunteering because when you volunteer with disadvantage communities it's challenging not to look down on them and reinforce the views they have actually those are steps 2 and 3 step 1 is to cut them off from the internet trade in the smart phones for flip phones parental controls on the computers and move any computers out of their bedrooms he needs to treat this like you'd treat a ten year old who's been caught with internet porn as for college if they want to go they should pay their own way that means debt work during school and a higher dti ratio after graduating so far they have been the recipients of others' work and deceived themselves into believing they have earned it or deserve it let them see what they can earn without daddy's help the experience should provide empathy but even if it doesn't it will help prevent their joining the yacht club frats that breed racism on campus oop they go to public school but it's one of the best ones in california and is almost all white i don't think kids are technically recruited but there's always a few that drive in from oakland or richmond to play sports because it's a pretty good football school i didn't think of what you were saying though but maybe sending them to oakland high or even skyline could be the move top comment squilliamfancyson95 it's a crazy idea but hear me out it could benefit them to sit down and talk with a reformed white supremacist they need to look at what they could become in the future and hear from someone who's thought like them and learned from their mistakes there are lots of groups out there that help to de radicalize members from hate groups and help them rehabilitate like life after hate if you can find one of these organizations reach out and see if they can help you with this situation i really wish you the best of luck update oct 26 2020 5 days later college sorry title ran out of characters link to original thread first and foremost i want to thank everyone for their genuine advice i got so many dms after the comments were locked with specific youtube videos to show my brother and his kids and it's really heartwarming knowing people have been through something similar and have made it out the other end this is an interesting situation for me to be in because they are family and very close but it is obviously my brother's and his wife's decision and i'm just here to support it i showed them every comment and we were just talking about everything in their backyard thursday night i was surprised by my brother saying i'm not backing down but we need to make sure they don't feel completely cut off we need to treat them normally tell them we love them reinforce positive behavior eat dinners as a family etc etc there were a few comments suggesting that punishment will only reinforce their belief that they are the victims of this situation and we discussed how important it is for them to still feel loved and supported and then we decided i would take them backpacking just to get some space between them and their parents i didn't have any big speech or anything planned i wanted to go into it letting them initiate the conversation and me just listening and asking questions so that's what i did we did a two night trip up in tahoe along the pct it was nice enough weatherwise but got really cold friday night luckily we were able to stumble upon one of the sierra club huts so we had great shelter but i think it toughened them up a little bit and i was pleasantly surprised by their resilience the boys were really grumpy and didn't talk at all on the drive up and it was pretty quiet for the first mile or so and then they just started talking the younger one just said do you really think dad was being serious and i just responded i'm not entirely sure but ultimately it's up to him why do you ask do you think that's fair they started complaining about how it wasn't fair and how he's just been tricked by the leftist media and i just kept asking them why they thought that and was trying just to get them to say the stuff they were thinking out loud with hopes that they would hear how crazy it sounds we got to the lake on day two and it was a much better day they really felt like the kids i watched growing up and they started reminiscing over past family trips and school before covid we talked about sports girls everything i was careful but i tried to thread in points about racism and privilege to what we were talking about like with their black teammates on the football team and i asked them what they had to go through at their school and what they've overcome turns out one of the kids has gone through some major shit that he's shared with the football team and i honestly feel like i got them to empathize we talked about politics too and i stressed to them that there's nothing wrong with being republican but you have form your own ideas about things instead of repeating what talking heads say i asked them about their social studies classes and it really feels like their trying to be contrarians because they loooove to argue and they said they get into arguments all the time in class all in all i just wanted them to feel like they weren't being abandoned and my goal was just to listen because it was my fear that they felt they weren't being heard and would then lash out we got home yesterday afternoon and their parents made them a big lunch and we all ate together talked about the trip and laughed together toward the end of the meal their dad got more serious and talked about last week he said something to the tune of i want you to know that we love you very much and always will we're proud of so many things that you have done but we need to be clear that this racist and hateful behavior is not okay he then said that they are both getting jobs as soon as possible and their dad is letting them put that money into their own checking accounts and then he has separate accounts set up for their education and told them that he will match each dollar they put in the education account and if there's any left over at the end of college it's their's to do with what they please the parents will still feed them and buy them clothes but everything else including gas and auto insurance is on them the boys were annoyed by this obviously but they seemed relieved that they weren't going to have to pay for all of their own college additionally he asked them how much screentime per day do they think is reasonable they said 2 hours and their dad said maybe one day but let's find a middle ground and they agreed on 1 hour a day after their homework sports and jobs were completed and they could only use devices in common areas of the house after the hour they're going to show mom or dad what they watched or played he also told them they were getting flip phones and if they wanted an iphone again they could pay for it themselves me and my brother discussed a few of the comments that were kind enough to shed light on forcing them to volunteer and we heard you the last stipulation was that they are going to volunteer with a charity of their choice once a month doesn't have to be in oakland or to do with poc and they would be the ones to reach out and set it up all in all i think this weekend was a success the boys are mad but it feels like their overwhelmed with this new sense of responsibility which i think is a good thing because it means they're taking this seriously now it's on their parents to keep up with it and enforce everything we are asking around to see if any of our friends know a reformed racist person to talk to them but i think we might wait to see how this plays out a little bit thank you everyone for your support and advice i might make another update in a few months to let you know how this all goes tl dr took niblings camping and listened to what they have to say their dad told them they were getting jobs he will match each dollar they put towards education no more iphones 1 hour screen time on family devices in common areas that is monitored by mom and dad volunteer once a month top comment kremla_co your brother did the right thing and actually i wouldn't have even paid for anything since they're so much better imagine talking all that shit and getting cs how about they pull themselves up by their bootstraps and work hard like they claim you don't get to bum off your parents and feel like you're superior sorry this is real life not fucking 4chan this is a repost sub i am

black people and are more deserving of going to college my brother told them if they cant recognize their privilege they can figure out how to pay for college originally posted to r relationshipadvice trigger warning racism mood spoiler hopeful original post rareddit oct 21 2020 my brother doesnt use reddit so i thought id try and get some advice for him these kids were always a bit odd and awkward but we always just chopped that up to being kids we are all very close i see them twice a week about i live in oakland and they live about 10 minutes east of oakland which is a very white suburb the boys said theres 5 black people at their school and they were all recruited to play sports there and they both play football and are teammates with a few of them but its not like we live in the south or anything they literally repeat shit you see on 4chan are all about qanon and start arguments any time they can i remember being a teenage boy and loved pushing buttons but they will say the most misogynistic homophobic racists stuff and then when i try to talk to them about it they call me a liberal snowflake i try to approach it by asking questions and guiding their thought process saying how would you feel if xyz and they say i wouldnt care cuz i would just work hard or i wouldnt whine about it ive obviously talked to my brother about this privately and hes just at his wits end i suggested he force them to volunteer in oakland or something like that and try to show them how normal people of less privilege are ive always thought if you get exposed to the group you are adverse to youll realize how similar you both are my brother finally snapped and asked them why they get to go to college and not all the kids at oakland tech and they literally said theyre better than them and its proven to be such and they deserve to go to college more because affirmative action is bullshit mind you they both get mostly cs and a few bs my brother acted out of impulse and told them they can find their own way to pay for college but is sticking to his guns and now the boys wont talk to him and have told me they blame black people for getting their dad to think this way i am shocked by their behavior but feel my brothers decision will just push them further down this path its ok for them to be republican hell if they were just trump supporters i feel like they could make it work to just avoid certain conversations but it feels like theyre steps away from becoming nazis any advice tl dr nephews have turned into alt right bigots and brother said if they cant recognize their privilege then they do relevant comments caughtup12 tell your brother that he is the man these kids will get a firm reality check in their coming years if they dont change their outlook on life and

come home at first since we are not in a great situation financially i started bawling and begging and i think he realized i was serious when he got home i was sitting on the bathroom floor i was a wreck cried so hard i vomited anyways bf gets back to our apartment finds me on the floor and as soon as he sees the pregnancy test he fucking smiles his face lit up and i saw red no acknowledgement of the state i was in the first thing he said to me besides what's going on was oh my god baby this is great i wanted to put my head through the wall i tried to explain to him through snot and tears and spit that no this was not great we're both full time students with jobs i can't take time off i have a ton of unresolved health issues we can barely afford the roof over our heads i hate the idea of getting an abortion i am all for it when it's someone else just for me i don't know if i can bring myself to do it he left me to cool down in the bathroom for a while i told him to get out and i saw one of my fucking blister packs in the bathroom trash can we don't use it very often so we only empty it once in a while i threw away the pregnancy test it knocked aside a wad of toilet paper and the silver foil caught my eye i dug through the trash and i found 7 of my regular fucking birth control pills at the bottom of the trash bag i can't believe he not only did this to me but also was so incredibly careless it's like he barely tried to hide it i can't tell if he wanted me to find out or if he just genuinely doesn't have anything knocking around inside his cranium besides a few rocks i had been wracking my brain trying to figure out how this could've happened i am so so diligent about taking my meds i feel so fucking stupid so so so stupid the sugar pills are literally a different fucking color i take like 7 pills in the morning and unceremoniously dump them into my mouth i definitely didn't look closely at them he didn't give me a reason to think i had to he hadn't said anything about kids i could tell he was kind of trying to be better about his responsibilities lately i thought things were finally starting to look up when it came to the state of our relationship we have access to each other's phones i think he probably checked my fitbit app to find out when i was ovulating since i track my period there i don't know how else he could've known i think i remember a few times i'd unlock my phone and find the app open but i thought nothing of it i confided in a few close friends about all of this told them everything what he did how i think he did it how i think his mom might've told him to how fucking devastated i am and how stupid i feel in essence they told me i need to grow a spine leave him stop going crazy and figure my shit out decide what to do now a part of me feel like i migjt be overreacting im staying with my parents right now they don't know what's going on they're kind of religious and i'm not exactly sure how they feel about abortion i

was urgent he didnt want to come home at first since we are not in a great situation financially i started bawling and begging and i think he realized i was serious when he got home i was sitting on the bathroom floor i was a wreck cried so hard i vomited anyways bf gets back to our apartment finds me on the floor and as soon as he sees the pregnancy test he fucking smiles his face lit up and i saw red no acknowledgement of the state i was in the first thing he said to me besides whats going on was oh my god baby this is great i wanted to put my head through the wall i tried to explain to him through snot and tears and spit that no this was not great were both full time students with jobs i cant take time off i have a ton of unresolved health issues we can barely afford the roof over our heads i hate the idea of getting an abortion i am all for it when its someone else just for me i dont know if i can bring myself to do it he left me to cool down in the bathroom for a while i told him to get out and i saw one of my fucking blister packs in the bathroom trash can we dont use it very often so we only empty it once in a while i threw away the pregnancy test it knocked aside a wad of toilet paper and the silver foil caught my eye i dug through the trash and i found 7 of my regular fucking birth control pills at the bottom of the trash bag i cant believe he not only did this to me but also was so incredibly careless its like he barely tried to hide it i cant tell if he wanted me to find out or if he just genuinely doesnt have anything knocking around inside his cranium besides a few rocks i had been wracking my brain trying to figure out how this couldve happened i am so so diligent about taking my meds i feel so fucking stupid so so so stupid the sugar pills are literally a different fucking color i take like 7 pills in the morning and unceremoniously dump them into my mouth i definitely didnt look closely at them he didnt give me a reason to think i had to he hadnt said anything about kids i could tell he was kind of trying to be better about his responsibilities lately i thought things were finally starting to look up when it came to the state of our relationship we have access to each others phones i think he probably checked my fitbit app to find out when i was ovulating since i track my period there i dont know how else he couldve known i think i remember a few times id unlock my phone and find the app open but i thought nothing of it i confided in a few close friends about all of this told them everything what he did how i think he did it how i think his mom mightve told him to how fucking devastated i am and how stupid i feel in essence they told me i need to grow a spine leave him stop going crazy and figure my shit out decide what to do now a part of me feel like i migjt be overreacting im staying with my parents right now they dont know whats going on theyre kind of religious and im not exactly sure how they feel about abortion i dont want to bring it up because i dont know how theyll react bf has been texting me nonstop telling me to calm down and come home and talk to him im so fucking lost sorry if this is a mess im not proofreading i dont have the bandwidth right now quick edit im terminating im chronically ill id have an extremely risky pregnancy and i dont want to bring a kid into this environment ive made an appointment but im still so scared i also had my friend gently prod my ex over text about what happened and he didnt even have to do much he bent immediately saying he needed to get it off his chest and that he feels like a terrible person he is i am leaving that goddamn scumbag scourge on my life far behind me he just doesnt know it yet,0.30246913580246915,0.0
Reddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1nerbcc/asmongold_puts_out_a_video_on_the_kirk_shooting/,0.056671188793538614,asmongold puts out a video on the kirk shooting saying the left is responsible for 90 of political violence and that the right is going to take it anymore typo in the title should be isn't going to take it anymore background asmongold is a hugely popular twitch and youtube personality who built his brand on blunt commentary and reaction content but over time his takes have grown more openly inflammatory he's been criticized for racist remarks culture war talking points and for defending figures like elon musk which many see as part of a broader drift further right in his politics his subreddit r asmongold reflects that shift a mix of devoted fans increasingly reactionary views and drama over whether his community has become a pipeline for culture war grievances context asmongold posted a video yesterday in the aftermath of the charlie kirk assassination in which he says 90 of political violence is from the left who continue to terrorize people daily and that until violence happens to them it isn't going to stop that they reap what they sow here is a transcribed portion of his video right wing people are not going to continue to turn the other cheek they're not going to continue to just 'oh well this is just another crazy left wing radical' i think you're probably going to see right wing people doing the same thing to left wing people and honestly while i don't see this as a good thing i certainly don't feel that sorry for them because a lot of left wing people have no problem advocating for violence or at least using coded language in order to advocate for violence the fact of the matter is there's a certain level of intellectual dishonesty that goes on in situations like this where it's considered 'oh well this isn't actually what they meant' or 'no this is actually some other ' no it is it's exactly what they mean they're trying to advocate for killing people that they disagree with that's what's happening and there's no talking around it and to the extent if you try to you're insulting the intelligence of anyone you're speaking to and i think that now what you're going to see is a lot of right wing people end up doing this to left wing people now even more because it's very clear that these social media platforms are not going to moderate this behavior the fbi for whatever reason just refuses to deal with or have any degree of accountability for dealing with these obvious terrorists that are in the country and because of that you're going to start seeing an uptick in violence from right wing people as well and this is going to be in my opinion i don't think the word for it is 'justified ' because it's not justified but the word is 'expected ' i think it's going to be expected the fact is again you bring a knife to a gun fight you're going to lose and don't be surprised if you bring guns to gunfights and somebody starts to decide to start shooting back this video is posted to his subreddit asmon just posted on his channel and the reaction is pretty mixed there's a lot of die hard support but also dozens of people pushing back against the 90 and left vs right narrative mods deleted a lot of the really bad stuff but there's still a lot left to highlight comments a new fan is welcomed into the roach kingdom i've never been a consumer of his content before just fell into this sub somehow damn well said though and you could already see it clear as day reading any commentary online we're in the shit for sure this is how most people find him if not through gaming which is less so nowadays he's demonised by some but spend some time listening and you'll realise a lot of what he is saying is simply the common sense reality i worry for him though in the current climate he is articulate and at times entertaining i like the guy but he also talks some utter rubbish at times one man's rubbish is another man's treasure welcome to the roach kingdom and say goodby to other subreddit your going to be assisanated by the woke mods over any other subs just by being here heck even if havent joined here and they find out you made a comment here they insta ban you it's weird that the first time i heard of him was a random comment on reddit calling him evil i decided to watch the original clip and actually found him moderate like a normal person then i started to watch him more because albeit his weird personal lifestyles his opinions are what normal people think the ann asmon news network is better than any mainstream ones these days not even kidding his 90 statistic that he pulled out of his ass is pure revisionist history however everything shows that the majority of politically motivated killings or attempted killing in the us over the last decade is majority right wing in origin but asmon doesn't read studies he largely goes off of vibes and what social media algorithms show him he can be level headed when he's informed but he doesn't take the effort to get informed editors note this link is spammed 24 times across the whole post since 1990 far right extremists have carried out 227 ideologically motivated homicides resulting in more than 520 deaths far left extremists were responsible for 42 such attacks with 78 deaths i am curious how his comments are damn well said when the facts are brought to light feelings don't care about your facts what about blm antifa events like this really show unhinged and fucked up the radicals are i saw a comment earlier that i feel really rings true they have spent years convincing themselves that mere words and opinions are equal to violence to them this murder was justified as an act of self defense lunacy that line of thinking is terrifying since 1990 far right extremists have carried out 227 ideologically motivated homicides resulting in more than 520 deaths in contrast far left extremists were responsible for 42 such attacks with 78 deaths you people keep posting a study that conveniently leaves out the targeted assassinations and the dozens of deaths from the blm antifa insurrections of 2016 2020 why would you do something like that just go on the internet and lie please tell me which targeted assasinations by blm i am sure i would have heard about it on the conservative subreddit which i didn't but i am open to be enlightend because here are some targeted murder and killing some attempts by rigth with lunatics which not all right wings are posts statistics lol you're going to be downvoted for providing factually verified information we don't do that here the reality is this needs to stop being a left vs right these killers are insane their political affiliation doesn't really matter as they're not living in the same reality as the rest of us what about the islamic sect and trans issue the thing is saying this is a 90 left wing problem is such an easily provably false statement that takes 5 minutes of searching to find studies showing this is not the case i've linked some recent studies below showing that this is untrue it really seems asmongold is justifying the right for right wing people to settle the score here and i am concerned that amplifying the issue is definitely not the solution can't we all agree that there are crazy people on every side of the spectrum and should focus on improving mental health across the board instead of just pointing the blame we don't even know the political ideology of the shooter at this point hell even the trump shooter was a republican these on the face of it just propose that white supremacy is likely to be the main motive for political violence not that it is sounds like more bs to push a narrative can you list right wing assassination attempts over the last few years on the left we have off the top of my mind charlie trump multiple times fuentes luigi and those are just the high profile ones take a step further and show me how the right celebrates these murders the way the left so openly does then i'm not sure if you want to include the islamic sect since the left is buddy buddy with that or the trans issue let's not even talk about what left wing policies are doing to usa and europe no you are wrong and trying to justify your shitty beliefs to make up for your failures in life the left is dying and thank god for that these tragedies are just accelerating the fall right wing assassinations under the last few years why would there be no democratic president has impinged on the civil liberties of so many citizens in such a divisive authoritarian way for many years until trump people did not become so hyper polarised politically and they didn't feel pushed to commit such extreme acts yes there were polarising political events but it wasn't the neverending all encompassing culture war it is now i absolutely do not advocate political violence on any side but am firm in the belief this is a predictable outcome when you exist in such an antagonistic political climate the language and vitriol on both sides whether that is politicians individual citizens or the media is creating the precise environment for those with mental health issues to make the jump to more extreme behaviours people have to take a hard look at trump because like him or not he has been central in cultivating this political climate which mirrors the way he himself conducts his affairs it's unlikely you would see a democrat president ruling in the same way trump does but if you did then i am sure you would see more of exactly the same behaviours on the other side back people into a corner and they become unpredictable this isn't a left vs right issue there is an awful lot of crazy on both sides to suggest otherwise is moronic yeah this is trump fault again not that every single mainstream media portrayed him as literally hitler since 2015 so you have nothing got it interesting how that happens what the fuck are you talking about minnesota happened less than 3 months ago it has been like 3 months since two democrat legislators were assasinated you mean the legislator whose final vote was with the republicans against illegal aliens how about attacks on civilians like charlie i'm beginning to think the only solution to this is national divorce i think he meant the guy that shot two democratic legislators had a list on him with more democrats on it that he planned to kill voted in the republican primaries went to multiple trump events and held conservative political and religious views according to people that knew him yes as much as i can believe right wingers being more prone to violence we have to be careful with those studies and statistics since europe was mentioned in the last abstract i can tell you that for instance in germany not long ago anti lgbtq or anti semitic violence done by both muslims or radical leftists in the case of anti semitism were counted as right wing crime implying neo nazis due to the target and not the perpetrator i think they dont do that anymore though in germany also an official data request came back showing that the right wing afd had the highest amount of violent attacks against them where the police found the perpetrators to be definitly left wing while the greens on 2nd place had a mix of perpetrators yet media outlets always said that the greens were the biggest target of violence bc they recieved way more mean messages online so its always a matter of who counts what there has been an undeniable radicalization on the left when it comes to violent behavior in the past 5 to maybe 10 years this will only justify violent right wingers to get one up on them it is going to turn into a literal death spiral this was just in response to asmon stating 90 of political violence comes from the left which obviously is not true i agree with your sentiment and i am not pointing blame at the right wing don't think right wingers are inherently violent but wanted to rebut asmon's claim which everyone with eyes can see is true yeah but you see this leftist with a liberal arts phd in an uber liberal private college did a study that proved him wrong like really this isn't shit that anyone can take seriously i'm sure they would label any antisemitic related events as right wing even though the vast majority today is being carried out by the regressive left and the mainstream right has disavowed every right wing hate group since basically the left started calling them right wing the truth is that 90 of all violence is carried out by people who vote predominantly dem violent rhetoric is overwhelmingly been a tactic used by the left in the past 5 to 10 years especially used to silent anyone they don't agree with punch a nazi to everyone i disagree with is a literally nazi to left wing violence and then you have the response right related violence is quickly disavowed by the mainstream and majority of the right base left wing violence is celebrated left and right need to chill out but left needs to more he's not justifying or encouraging the right wing start settling the score he's stating that he's worried that this will spark more and move violence in no way is he encouraging it then he should stop trying to argue this as a left vs right that's part of the problem he's a part of the news sources he's literally complaining about in the video these killers are insane people their political affiliation is irrelevant because they're nuts you're free to believe that i think you're wrong but it still stands that he's not encouraging violence which was the whole point here he's creating a political divide that does create violence just because it's 2 rungs down the ladder doesn't mean it isn't the same ladder we need to stop dividing and all come together on this these shootings are unacceptable they're being done by insane people that happen to be using that divide as a weapon describing what he thinks is happening is not being divisive you're completely misunderstanding the video you're pretty much asking him to not talk about it there's a difference between describing how terrible this is and placing direct blame on the left or right he's placing blame before the fbi have even apprehended the guy it's already becoming a left vs right yet there isn't even a suspect it's ridiculous we should be coming together to condemn this instead of entertaining the opinions of crazy people on facebook and twitter but no lets make it left vs right and further divide the people that'll surely help im done with convo it's obvious that it was a politically motivated murder it's common sense to call it what it is the entire original point of this conversation was that asmon was not trying to incentivize the right retaliating we've gone down an irrelevant path it's fair for him to point out that the lefts rhetoric has lead to this because it obviously has same way right leaning rhetoric can lead to political hit jobs the left and right need to chill out but in this specific case the left needs to more people are waking up i think asmon has it backwards there was already one successful assassination on democratic representative melissa hortman and her husband the wounding of another democratic lawmaker at the same time and the attempted assassination of josh shapiro this year thinking that the death of charlie kirk is going to somehow kickstart violence from the right is false it was already happening other than kirk there have been no verified attempts or successful assassinations on republicans this year let me be very clear here though i am in no way supporting the death of kirk nor am i happy that he was killed just sharing information yeah just ignore europe afd politicians fuentes luigi and multiple attempts on trump the only thing that gives me any sort of peace is that leftist authoritarian ideology is finally dying worldwide and people are stopping to make excuses for this hateful behaviour people are unashamedly waking up and it's about damn time the trump assassination attempts were both done by registered republicans you already know this though lol didn't the incel donate multiple times to act share blue political party registration means nothing my mom's a registered democrat because the last time she voted in a primary the national republican race was already over and the congressional district had an incumbent republican a conversation about how there has only been one right wing shooter in recent times with a bonus the left doesn't like jews when talking about violence in terms of property damage the left wins each year but on the topic of murder this is simply not true so far rightwing motivated murders have always been significantly higher in the us idk with all the bias in the media i wouldnt be surprised if lots of leftist murders attacks were deliberately underreported or attributed to other groups basically the data may very well be manipulated to make us all believe that most politically motivated crimes are far right but reality might actually be different especially with all the open demonization the left does like calling people far right and nazis out of nothing etc this definitely does radicalize people and can incite violence wheras todays right wing narratives are much less agressive out of fear of being instantly labeled a nazi or some other sh t they already memory holed the summer of love they will attribute deaths to jan 6 riot unrelated to the events but can't even count the murders of the insurrection in seattle lol i literally can't even think of one but i can think of multiple assassination attempts and politically motivated attacks against the right i mean in the last couple years you have the minnesota shootings gov shapiro attempt pelosi's husband michigan governor plot arizona dnc shot up multiple times to act like there is no right wing violence is putting your head in the sand edit lake county cop killings buffalo ny supermarket several synagogue shootings charlottesville car attack colorado planned parenthood shooting etc minnesota the guy was a pro immigration walz appointee who claimed walz told him to do it shapiro not a republican palestine protestor pelosi not a republican or politically motivated michigan like 9 of the 12 people were fbi agents arizona bb gun just so we're clear your most legitimate example of violence is a bb gun which caused no injuries you cant even think of an example editing after being wrong is pretty pathetic lake county cop killings not political buffalo ny supermarket not political several synagogue shootings its the left that doesn't like jews btw not political charlottesville car attack probably your closest colorado planned parenthood shooting not political so you're at 1 and a bb gun yeah buddy if you're 100 bought into instagram conspiracy theories like you clearly are then correct the right has never done anything wrong and the left is always evil you're dead wrong on the pelosi minnesota and the michigan plot and that's not even bringing up all the mass shootings and things like january 6th i'll just leave you with this when violence targets republicans democrats condemn it when violence targets democrats too many republicans excuse it make jokes or even pardon the attackers look at what djt jr said posted about pelosi mike lee posted about minnesota or trump's pardon of the january 6th rioters responsibility for this violence lies solely at the feet of trump and his supporters you're just objectively wrong i know it is frustrating but you weren't able to name more than one continued from above for mobile users are we pretending that the trump shooter who was successful in wounding him and killing another was not a registered republican the guy who donated to biden through act blue didn't he donate 5 dollars i don't think that makes him a biden supporter and i'm not sure he's a trump supporter he's probably not since he tried to kill him i do definitely see people every single day claiming that the entire left tried to assassinate trump and blaming tens of millions of people for isolated incidents you can't even get the amount right maybe sit this out it's the left that doesn't like jews you're really making stuff up now have you heard what nick fuentes who everyone is accepting is right wing now because he is sneako tucker carlson and other prominent people on the right have to say about jews supposedly controlling the world the world banks and the shadow governments it's not pretty disgusting actually and i sympathize with the regular jewish people who are trying to live their lives without being tied to the holocaust and israel every five minutes mainstream democrats support overthrowing the jewish state and were forcing jewish students off campus mainstream republicans pretty adamantly support israel and want to protect jewish americans from protestors particularly on campus the left objectively hates jews casual death threats on leftist streamer hasan's life who they say is responsible for this if this is even remotely acceptable to these people i hope they realise it means the unaliving of hassan diddy binladen piker is now totally on the table and they have no arguments against it they are lucky the right tgey hate is not as mental as them you have no idea what the motivations of the shooter are by assuming they are left wing and justifying violence against hasan you're contributing to the political climate that got charlie kirk killed you should be ashamed of yourself radical left extremists like hasan already incite violence for a long time without repercussions and twitch allows it on their platform both twitch and hasan have charlie's blood on their hands imo killing politicans is whatever killing a guy talking about politics is worse charlie kirk is the breaking point really really not the outrighted assassination of two minnesota lawmakers and their spouses by a guy with a list of democrats to kill because charlie kirk isn't a politician he was just a guy talking about politics killing politicians is obviously bad but they're the ones who are actually effecting the country killing a guy for simply talking about politics is a step further you're not just after

with is a literally nazi to left wing violence and then you have the response right related violence is quickly disavowed by the mainstream and majority of the right base left wing violence is celebrated left and right need to chill out but left needs to more hes not justifying or encouraging the right wing start settling the score hes stating that hes worried that this will spark more and move violence in no way is he encouraging it then he should stop trying to argue this as a left vs right thats part of the problem hes a part of the news sources hes literally complaining about in the video these killers are insane people their political affiliation is irrelevant because theyre nuts youre free to believe that i think youre wrong but it still stands that hes not encouraging violence which was the whole point here hes creating a political divide that does create violence just because its 2 rungs down the ladder doesnt mean it isnt the same ladder we need to stop dividing and all come together on this these shootings are unacceptable theyre being done by insane people that happen to be using that divide as a weapon describing what he thinks is happening is not being divisive youre completely misunderstanding the video youre pretty much asking him to not talk about it theres a difference between describing how terrible this is and placing direct blame on the left or right hes placing blame before the fbi have even apprehended the guy its already becoming a left vs right yet there isnt even a suspect its ridiculous we should be coming together to condemn this instead of entertaining the opinions of crazy people on facebook and twitter but no lets make it left vs right and further divide the people thatll surely help im done with convo its obvious that it was a politically motivated murder its common sense to call it what it is the entire original point of this conversation was that asmon was not trying to incentivize the right retaliating weve gone down an irrelevant path its fair for him to point out that the lefts rhetoric has lead to this because it obviously has same way right leaning rhetoric can lead to political hit jobs the left and right need to chill out but in this specific case the left needs to more people are waking up i think asmon has it backwards there was already one successful assassination on democratic representative melissa hortman and her husband the wounding of another democratic lawmaker at the same time and the attempted assassination of josh shapiro this year thinking that the death of charlie kirk is going to somehow kickstart violence from the right is false it was already happening other than kirk there have been no verified attempts or successful assassinations on republicans this year let me be very clear here though i am in no way supporting the death of kirk nor am i happy that he was killed just sharing information yeah just ignore europe afd politicians fuentes luigi and multiple attempts on trump the only thing that gives me any sort of peace is that leftist authoritarian ideology is finally dying worldwide and people are stopping to make excuses for this hateful behaviour people are unashamedly waking up and its about damn time the trump assassination attempts were both done by registered republicans you already know this though lol didnt the incel donate multiple times to act share blue political party registration means nothing my moms a registered democrat because the last time she voted in a primary the national republican race was already over and the congressional district had an incumbent republican a conversation about how there has only been one right wing shooter in recent times with a bonus the left doesnt like jews when talking about violence in terms of property damage the left wins each year but on the topic of murder this is simply not true so far rightwing motivated murders have always been significantly higher in the us idk with all the bias in the media i wouldnt be surprised if lots of leftist murders attacks were deliberately underreported or attributed to other groups basically the data may very well be manipulated to make us all believe that most politically motivated crimes are far right but reality might actually be different especially with all the open demonization the left does like calling people far right and nazis out of nothing etc this definitely does radicalize people and can incite violence wheras todays right wing narratives are much less agressive out of fear of being instantly labeled a nazi or some other sh t they already memory holed the summer of love they will attribute deaths to jan 6 riot unrelated to the events but cant even count the murders of the insurrection in seattle lol i literally cant even think of one but i can think of multiple assassination attempts and politically motivated attacks against the right i mean in the last couple years you have the minnesota shootings gov shapiro attempt pelosis husband michigan governor plot arizona dnc shot up multiple times to act like there is no right wing violence is putting your head in the sand edit lake county cop killings buffalo ny supermarket several synagogue shootings charlottesville car attack colorado planned parenthood shooting etc minnesota the guy was a pro immigration walz appointee who claimed walz told him to do it shapiro not a republican palestine protestor pelosi not a republican or politically motivated michigan like 9 of the 12 people were fbi agents arizona bb gun just so were clear your most legitimate example of violence is a bb gun which caused no injuries you cant even think of an example editing after being wrong is pretty pathetic lake county cop killings not political buffalo ny supermarket not political several synagogue shootings its the left that doesnt like jews btw not political charlottesville car attack probably your closest colorado planned parenthood shooting not political so youre at 1 and a bb gun yeah buddy if youre 100 bought into instagram conspiracy theories like you clearly are then correct the right has never done anything wrong and the left is always evil youre dead wrong on the pelosi minnesota and the michigan plot and thats not even bringing up all the mass shootings and things like january 6th ill just leave you with this when violence targets republicans democrats condemn it when violence targets democrats too many republicans excuse it make jokes or even pardon the attackers look at what djt jr said posted about pelosi mike lee posted about minnesota or trumps pardon of the january 6th rioters responsibility for this violence lies solely at the feet of trump and his supporters youre just objectively wrong i know it is frustrating but you werent able to name more than one continued from above for mobile users are we pretending that the trump shooter who was successful in wounding him and killing another was not a registered republican the guy who donated to biden through act blue didnt he donate 5 dollars i dont think that makes him a biden supporter and im not sure hes a trump supporter hes probably not since he tried to kill him i do definitely see people every single day claiming that the entire left tried to assassinate trump and blaming tens of millions of people for isolated incidents you cant even get the amount right maybe sit this out its the left that doesnt like jews youre really making stuff up now have you heard what nick fuentes who everyone is accepting is right wing now because he is sneako tucker carlson and other prominent people on the right have to say about jews supposedly controlling the world the world banks and the shadow governments its not pretty disgusting actually and i sympathize with the regular jewish people who are trying to live their lives without being tied to the holocaust and israel every five minutes mainstream democrats support overthrowing the jewish state and were forcing jewish students off campus mainstream republicans pretty adamantly support israel and want to protect jewish americans from protestors particularly on campus the left objectively hates jews casual death threats on leftist streamer hasans life who they say is responsible for this if this is even remotely acceptable to these people i hope they realise it means the unaliving of hassan diddy binladen piker is now totally on the table and they have no arguments against it they are lucky the right tgey hate is not as mental as them you have no idea what the motivations of the shooter are by assuming they are left wing and justifying violence against hasan youre contributing to the political climate that got charlie kirk killed you should be ashamed of yourself radical left extremists like hasan already incite violence for a long time without repercussions and twitch allows it on their platform both twitch and hasan have charlies blood on their hands imo killing politicans is whatever killing a guy talking about politics is worse charlie kirk is the breaking point really really not the outrighted assassination of two minnesota lawmakers and their spouses by a guy with a list of democrats to kill because charlie kirk isnt a politician he was just a guy talking about politics killing politicians is obviously bad but theyre the ones who are actually effecting the country killing a guy for simply talking about politics is a step further youre not just after the opposition but their supporters as well,1.0000000000000002,0.0

fighting for custody let me get this straight if a wife cheats on her husband july 29 2022 the next day and gets pregnant and her husband forgives her and is willing to raise the child as his own the

biological father had any idea that they had a kid whether the husband plans to remain married to the wife the child's desires moreso as the child ages especially if the child is a teenager it's a

aunt gave to me since she won't be needing it when the rapture comes for those of who who are unaware theres a faction of christians out there who believe that the rapture is going to happen on tuesday my aunt is one of those people and she has been going around telling everybody how people will float into the sky and what not i'm queer and agnostic and while i was raised loosely christian i haven't identified with the religion since i was in 5th grade most of my family on my mother's side except for my aunt are christian but not particularly devout and certainly not as much as her nor do they believe in the rapture she apparently became very very involved in the religion at some point in college basically my entire life i have been ridiculed by my aunt for being queer since i came out at a young age most of my family was very kind accepting and understanding except for her i spent every family gathering getting basically cornered bullied harassed called slurs and preached at by a grown woman for my sexuality it got to the point that my mother had to have several sit down conversation with her to essentially tell her to quit harrassing me this endured for a long time and while my parents would always tell her to knock it off she never would but one day my mother seriously put her foot down against her she made it clear that my family accepted me and if she wouldn't tone it down she would no longer be welcome in our home or around me during this conversation my aunt allegedy called my family bad christians for not sending me to conversion therapy and that they would regret not making me repent once the 'rapture was upon us' but that was a few years ago and ever since then i mostly just get sideways glances from her at family events and the occasional bible verse text from her which i can manage i am now an adult 19 and in college and i was recently contacted by my aunt to meet up with her for lunch i assumed that maybe she had a change of heart and wanted to apologize for how she treated me this was not the case when we met up she essentially went on a long winded speil about how she pitys me and feels so sorry that i never repented and how i and the rest of my family will be left behind because we never fully gave our lives to christ at the end of her monologue she pulled out a stack of cash all in 100 dollar bills and handed it to me telling me that 'she wanted to give away her savings to those less fortunate since she wouldn't be needing it when the rapture comes and delivers her to the lord' i tried to talk her out of it but she insisted and practically forced the money into my hands before abruptly walking away i counted it when i got home and it was slightly over 40k in cash here's where i think i would be the ah when the rapture inevitably doesn't happen i have no plans of giving the money back to her i know shes been going through some kind of long enduring religious psychosis but i could honestly really use this type of cash to put me through college and handle other expenses and she gave it to me willingly wbita if i didn't give her back the money when the rapture doesn't happen edit my parents are now aware of this because she apparently decided to try to gift my younger sister a car her relatively new nice ford bronco i told my parents about the money and my mother who is also christian told me that it would be the most ethical thing to do if i gave it back to her and that i need to be empathetic to the struggles she's clearly going through my dad however thinks that if she was stupid enough to give away her life savings on a whim the money is better off going towards my education anyways im still torn edit update 2 just wanted to clarify a few things 1 i am a bisexual woman a few people here thought i was a man 2 i have no idea why she would want to give me of all people the money im just as confused as the rest of you from what i grasped it seemed as though it was some 'final act of kindness' towards somebody she takes great pity on i don't know lmfaoao as a few of you said i should probably leave some kind of trail to prove this was freely given and i didn't steal from her so there's no legal repercussions should i choose to keep it im still not sold on any course of action yet especially because its not wendsday yet so i sent her an email thanking her for the gift and reiterating that i did not originally want it but it was just oh so very gracious of her to give money to a poor sinner like me i don't want to take advantage of the mentally ill but the selfish part of me sees this as reparations for all the torment i endured when i was younger i've heard a few people say to invest the money instead of immediately putting it towards college and if i keep it that will definitely be considered i don't expect to update again until the 'rapture'has passed but i will update once that rolls around mini edit doing my own research on the current rapture craze going on they think the rapture will happen either tuesday 23rd or wed 24th so i will update on thursday thursday update hi all it's thursday so as promised heres the update everyone wanted and i will make it brief 1 no my aunt did not get raptured 2 no i will not be keeping the money which i know will upset some of you 3 no my sister did not get to keep the car as i know some people were wondering essentially as a lot of you predicted once the rapture didn't happen my aunt kept moving the goalpost it went from happening on tuesday to happening wednesday because its still tuesday for some parts of the world to happening sometime this month i decided not to keep the money and its not for any of the reasons i initially thought it would be trying to give me money and giving my sister a car were not the only things that she did because she thought the rapture was coming she quit her job as well and i found out just this morning she also allegedly confessed to her husband that she was having an affair with her co worker fellow church goer she works in admin for a megachurch in our area i think the reason she was doing all of this was to 'get right with god' before the rapture buy her way into heaven and have no secrets laying on her chest idk i can't pretend to understand the logic of somebody thats a rapture believer and since yknow the rapture did not happen her husband wants to file for divorce i'm not particularly worried about her job working for the church and all i'm pretty convinced they will take her back without a fuss because of how enshrined she was in the community but 1 i read a lot of your comments and i don't want to prove her right about how 'wicked' queer people and agnostics atheists are by keeping it and 2 she will definitely need it for her upcoming legal fees i'm unsure if this is her entire lifesavings but regardless after letting my emotions cool a bit i know i wouldn't feel right to keep it regardless my mom approved of my decision my dad was a bit disappointed but mostly because he was excited to potentially not have to spend any more money on me for college lmao oh and she has not explicitly asked for it back yet i imagine its because everything thats gone on has her feeling defeated or just generally in a low place but even if she doesn't i plan on giving it back to her when i can i'm a full time student with a part time job i don't have a whole lot of free time but i'll find a way to get it to her yeah sorry this isn't the update i know a lot of people wanted if anyone says they want to hear about the conversation when i
