From the article:  

""The irony of this termination and a slew of similar firings over the past 24 hours is that Kirk and Turning Point USA, the conservative youth group he co-founded, branded themselves as the ultimate defenders of free speech. In a June [debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnqSNEiLTeY) at the Oxford Union, during a tour of the U.K. in which he condemned the country for its “[totalitarian](https://x.com/charliekirk11/status/1924841802852708356)” censorship of its citizens, he argued, “You should be allowed to say outrageous things.” Last year, Kirk [posted](https://x.com/charliekirk11/status/1786189687260103119) on X: “Hate speech does not exist legally in America. There’s ugly speech. There’s gross speech. There’s evil speech. And ALL of it is protected by the First Amendment. Keep America free.”""",['hate speech']

Attorney General Pam Bondi said the above this week in an interview. What are these ""hate speech"" laws she is talking about? Has the first amendment been quietly repealed?

Attorney General Pam Bondi has just said, ""We will absolutely target you, go after you, if you are targeting anyone with hate speech, and that's across the aisle.""

That is the government using a ""hate speech"" justification, supposedly on either side of the aisle, to justify cracking down on free speech. 

Personally, I am very frustrated by this. I was accused of being a lot of unpleasant things in the past when I argued against using ""hate speech"" as a reason to restrict speech.  Now it's being turned around just like critics said it would.

Lots of people pointed out that the left wouldn't always be in charge of what is considered ""hate speech."" Lots of people said this will be turned around on the left–including people warning as well as people who were openly threatening. Many people said, we shouldn't engage in this kind of restriction and that it was a bad idea. 

So now that the threat of the government coming after people who aren't sad enough about an influencer is here, has anyone's perspective changed?",['hate speech']

Hello to my fellow neighbors in India.
I am a **Nepali citizen** living near the border, connected to both our countries not only geographically but also culturally. That is why I feel it is my duty to share the truth with you about what is really happening here.

You may have seen headlines claiming that Nepal is facing **“mass protests led by Gen Z against social media ban.”**
That is only a half-truth.

**Here is the real sequence of events:**

- Three days ago, the Nepal government suddenly banned 26 social media platforms including Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube, and Reddit.

- They claimed it was about registration and taxes. But these companies are already registered and paying taxes. The real motive is censorship: giving the government power to control online information, delete posts critical of them within 24 hours, and jail those who speak up.

- In the next two days, criticism exploded across the country. A date was set—September 8—for nationwide protests. But it was never just about social media. That ban was only the spark.


**Our patience had already run out.**

Soon, the “**Nepo Babies**” trend erupted in Nepal. It exposed the lavish lifestyles of politicians’ children—designer (clothes,bags, watches, attire )worth lakhs, luxury cars, million-rupee homes, weekly international flights, and even private jets—while ordinary Nepalis struggle daily for survival. Our PM has a salary less than 65k INR but what is owns is in million of $$$.

>This hit a nerve.
 Because Nepal has been under one form of tyranny or another for decades. From monarchy to so-called democracy, corruption and instability have never left us. Not a single prime minister has completed a full term in over 20 years.

[The protests were organized in the name of Gen Z, but they welcomed everyone. We were not just protesting a social media ban. We were standing against corruption, nepotism, tyranny, suppression, and decades of betrayal. In a country of just 30 million people, every single day around 5,000 youths leave to work abroad because there are no jobs, no decent pay, and no basic livelihood at home.]

And then the tragedy struck. Today, during the protest, I witnessed & carried something I will never forget. A 15-year-old schoolboy, still in uniform, was shot in the head by security forces—acting on orders from a minister. He was not the only one. Reports say more than 20 people have been killed, thousands injured, and the true numbers are being hidden.

I came home with blood still on my hands, only to see Indian news channels spinning a completely false narrative. They claimed it was all about social media and mocked our youths as being “**addicted**” to it. That angered me, but it didn’t surprise me. I know how the media can twist things.

That is why I am writing this here, to let you know the truth from the ground.

Hello. Recently, people in my country started calling out the children of corrupt politicians, and right after that, the government completely banned social media. We currently don’t have access to YouTube, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram, and around 20 other apps (I’m using a VPN right now). Even before the ban, people had already organized a protest for today.

At first, the protest was peaceful, but about three hours in, police started shooting at civilians. The country itself even labeled this the “Gen Z protest” since it was led mostly by young people, and many wore school uniforms because under UN law, it is considered a war crime to harm minors in uniform. But the police still shot children in grades 10–12 (three that I know of for sure so far), a 12-year-old, and around 20 others have been killed.

International media like BBC and The New York Times are undermining the protest by saying things like “13 killed” (without mentioning that actual children were killed) and framing it as “over a social media ban” (which makes it sound like we’re just upset we can’t use social media, when the real issue is so much bigger).

I honestly feel helpless right now. I’ve emailed major news outlets, but I don’t know if anything will come of it.

Is there anything else I can do?

Edit: My country is Nepal

Edit 2: Apparently, they're killing people who have raised their voice in their own house. This is terrifying. I'm scared

I feel like most people would agree that it’s fine to not be interested in the political side of things, as there are a lot of bands that strictly write from a personal standpoint, but to actively go against the message is insane when it’s “Let X/Y/Z group exist without harassing/killing them” and “We are governed by corrupt politicians that fund wars”.

English isn’t my first language, so sometimes I mispronounce words. Recently, we were having a conversation about politics and different minorities. He was on the opposing side of what I was saying, and while it wasn’t an argument, I guess he just wasn’t liking my perspective.

In the middle of that, I mispronounced a word and he responded by calling me a racial slur. The way he said it came off smug, almost like he thought it was clever.

The second it came out, and I asked him what he’d called me he went silent and I hung up the phone. Later he apologized and said he was stressed and not in the right headspace. For context, it was fight week for him, so he had been cutting a lot of weight, barely eating, and only drinking water. He admitted that had a major effect on his brain.

But earlier in our relationship we had already talked about boundaries, and I made it clear slurs were a hard line for me. So I broke up with him.
 He’s heartbroken and telling me that he wishes I’d talked to him first before coming to my decision of breaking up with him.

While this would seem to be obvious from a moral standpoint that white supremacy is degenerate position and chauvinistic, if you look deeper and really think about what is happening to the US socially and politically, the kind of self inflicted wounds can’t really be understood through any other lens. 

The idea of the mid-century white working class is so ingrained in the American psyche that we have voted for incoherent politicians and policies that will fail to bring these class relations back. 

American Unions like the UAW and teamsters have voted for protective tariffs that will not bring back jobs or increase the numbers of unionized workers and bring in more dues. 

Older white Americans are financing the removal of the cheap labor force that keeps their fixed income capable of feeding them in the name of cost savings. 

The absolute swindling taking place by the 1% is only possible because of the deep seated white supremacist logic ingrained in all americans. 

In geopolitical terms as well the US fixation on europe and by extension the middle east at the expense of east asia in a purely realist framework is illogical unless you account for white supremacy. 

It is the cardinal sin of the US and why it will fail now that imperial expansion is impossible.",['white supremacy']

My brother doesn't use reddit, so I thought I'd try and get some advice for him.

These kids were always a bit odd and awkward, but we always just chopped that up to being kids. We are all very close, I see them twice a week about. I live in Oakland, and they live about 10 minutes east of Oakland, which is a very white suburb. The boys said there's 5 black people at their school and they were all recruited to play sports there, and they both play football and are teammates with a few of them. But it's not like we live in the south or anything.

They literally repeat shit you see on 4chan, are all about Qanon, and start arguments any time they can. I remember being a teenage boy, and loved pushing buttons, but they will say the most misogynistic, homophobic, racists stuff, and then when I try to talk to them about it they call me a liberal snowflake. I try to approach it by asking questions, and guiding their thought process, saying ""how would you feel if xyz?"", and they say ""I wouldn't care cuz I would just work hard"" or ""I wouldn't whine about it""

I've obviously talked to my brother about this privately, and he's just at his wits end. I suggested he force them to volunteer in Oakland or something like that and try to show them how normal people of less privilege are. I've always thought if you get exposed to the group you are adverse to you'll realize how similar you both are.

My brother finally snapped and asked them why they get to go to college and not all the kids at Oakland Tech, and they literally said they're better than them, and it's proven to be such, and they deserve to go to college more because ""affirmative action is bullshit"". (Mind you they both get mostly C's and a few B's)

My brother acted out of impulse and told them they can find their own way to pay for college but is sticking to his guns, and now the boys won't talk to him, and have told me they blame black people for getting their dad to think this way.

I am shocked by their behavior, but feel my brother's decision will just push them further down this path. It's ok for them to be republican, hell if they were just trump supporters I feel like they could make it work to just avoid certain conversations. But it feels like they're steps away from becoming Nazi's.

Any advice?

tl;dr nephews have turned into alt-right bigots, and brother said if they can't recognize their privilege then they do

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**Caught_up12**

>Tell your brother that he is the MAN. These kids will get a firm reality check in their coming years if they don’t change their outlook on life and society. Sounds like they are headed down a destructive path, and fast. They are 16 and 14. They need their dad and will soon be begging for his help if he himself doesn’t budge. If he does, they know they can get away with this bs. Tell him to stand his ground!

**OOP**

>>That's what I said to him at first, like maybe should've threatened something smaller, because if he doesn't follow through with this, it'll be an empty threat and they won't take him seriously.

**~**

**Woodit**

>So I assume from the bit about the kids getting recruited to their school for sports that they’re in a private school. So step one would be send them to public school. They’ll get worse at first, seeing a large sample size with a spectrum of behavior from their peers of color, but they’ll see it from white kids as well, and they’ll see plenty of counter examples in the nonwhite kids. Eventually there will be so many exceptions to their standard view that it will hollow out, like a Swiss cheese of racist naivety.

>Step 2 is no more allowance, cars, luxuries, whatever else he is giving them. They want to earn and be better than others? Cool, go get shit jobs in fast food. The best route would be to work under managers who are not white. I think this is better than volunteering because when you volunteer with disadvantage communities it’s challenging not to look down on them and reinforce the views they have.

>Actually, those are steps 2 and 3. Step 1 is to cut them off from the Internet. Trade in the smart phones for flip phones. Parental controls on the computers, and move any computers out of their bedrooms. He needs to treat this like you’d treat a ten year old who’s been caught with internet porn.

>As for college, if they want to go, they should pay their own way. That means debt, work during school, and a higher DTI ratio after graduating. So far they have been the recipients of others’ work and deceived themselves into believing they have earned it, or deserve it. Let them see what they can earn without daddy’s help. The experience should provide empathy, but even if it doesn’t it will help prevent their joining the yacht-club frats that breed racism on campus.

**OOP**

>>They go to public school but it's one of the best ones in California, and is almost all white. I don't think kids are technically recruited, but there's always a few that drive in from Oakland or Richmond to play sports because it's a pretty good football school.

>>I didn't think of what you were saying though, but maybe sending them to Oakland High, or even Skyline could be the move

**TOP COMMENT**

**SquilliamFancySon95**

>It's a crazy idea, but hear me out.

>It could benefit them to sit down and talk with a reformed white supremacist.

>They need to look at what they could become in the future and hear from someone who's thought like them and learned from their mistakes. There are lots of groups out there that help to de-radicalize members from hate groups and help them rehabilitate like Life After Hate. If you can find one of these organizations, reach out and see if they can help you with this situation. I really wish you the best of luck.


[Update](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/jil6mt/update_my_39m_brother45ms_two_sons_16m_and_14m/)  **Oct 26, 2020 (5 days later)**

college. Sorry, title ran out of characters.

[Link to original thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/jfi9sa/my_39m_brother45ms_two_sons_16m_and_14m_somehow/)

First and foremost, I want to thank everyone for their genuine advice, I got so many DMs after the comments were locked with specific youtube videos to show my brother and his kids, and it's really heartwarming knowing people have been through something similar and have made it out the other end.

This is an interesting situation for me to be in, because they are family and very close, but it is obviously my brother's and his wife's decision, and I'm just here to support it.

I showed them every comment and we were just talking about everything in their backyard Thursday night. I was surprised by my brother saying ""I'm not backing down, but we need to make sure they don't feel completely cut off, we need to treat them normally, tell them we love them, reinforce positive behavior, eat dinners as a family etc etc""

There were a few comments suggesting that punishment will only reinforce their belief that they are the victims of this situation, and we discussed how important it is for them to still feel loved and supported. And then we decided I would take them backpacking just to get some space between them and their parents.

I didn't have any big speech or anything planned, I wanted to go into it letting them initiate the conversation, and me just listening and asking questions, so that's what I did.

We did a two night trip up in Tahoe along the PCT, it was nice enough weatherwise but got really cold Friday night, luckily we were able to stumble upon one of the Sierra Club huts so we had great shelter, but I think it toughened them up a little bit, and I was pleasantly surprised by their resilience.

The boys were really grumpy and didn't talk at all on the drive up, and it was pretty quiet for the first mile or so, and then they just started talking.

The younger one just said ""do you really think dad was being serious?"" and I just responded ""I'm not entirely sure, but ultimately it's up to him, why do you ask? Do you think that's fair?""

They started complaining about how it wasn't fair and how he's just been tricked by the leftist media, and I just kept asking them why they thought that, and was trying just to get them to say the stuff they were thinking out loud with hopes that they would hear how crazy it sounds.

We got to the lake on day two and it was a much better day, they really felt like the kids I watched growing up and they started reminiscing over past family trips and school before covid, we talked about sports, girls, everything, I was careful, but I tried to thread in points about racism and privilege to what we were talking about, like with their black teammates on the football team and I asked them what they had to go through at their school, and what they've overcome, turns out one of the kids has gone through some major shit that he's shared with the football team, and I honestly feel like I got them to empathize!

We talked about politics too and I stressed to them that there's nothing wrong with being republican, but you have form your own ideas about things instead of repeating what talking heads say. I asked them about their social studies classes, and it really feels like their trying to be contrarians because they loooove to argue, and they said they get into arguments all the time in class. 

All in all, I just wanted them to feel like they weren't being abandoned, and my goal was just to listen, because it was my fear that they felt they weren't being heard, and would then lash out.

We got home yesterday afternoon and their parents made them a big lunch, and we all ate together, talked about the trip, and laughed together.

Toward the end of the meal, their dad got more serious and talked about last week. He said something to the tune of ""I want you to know that we love you very much and always will, we're proud of so many things that you have done, but we need to be clear that this racist and hateful behavior is not okay""

He then said that they are both getting jobs as soon as possible, and their dad is letting them put that money into their own checking accounts, and then he has separate accounts set up for their education, and told them that he will match each dollar they put in the education account, and if there's any left over at the end of college, it's their's to do with what they please.

The parents will still feed them, and buy them clothes, but everything else including gas and auto insurance is on them. 

The boys were annoyed by this obviously, but they seemed relieved that they weren't going to have to pay for all of their own college.

Additionally, he asked them how much screentime per day do they think is reasonable, they said 2 hours, and their dad said, maybe one day, but let's find a middle ground, and they agreed on 1 hour a day after their homework, sports, and jobs were completed, and they could only use devices in common areas of the house. After the hour, they're going to show mom or dad what they watched or played. He also told them they were getting flip phones, and if they wanted an iphone again, they could pay for it themselves.

Me and my brother discussed a few of the comments that were kind enough to shed light on forcing them to volunteer, and we heard you. The last stipulation was that they are going to volunteer with a charity of their choice once a month (doesn't have to be in Oakland or to do with POC), and they would be the ones to reach out and set it up.

All in all, I think this weekend was a success, the boys are mad, but it feels like their overwhelmed with this new sense of responsibility, which I think is a good thing because it means they're taking this seriously. Now it's on their parents to keep up with it and enforce everything.

We are asking around to see if any of our friends know a reformed racist person to talk to them, but I think we might wait to see how this plays out a little bit.

Thank you everyone for your support and advice, I might make another update in a few months to let you know how this all goes.

**tl;dr Took niblings camping and listened to what they have to say. Their dad told them they were getting jobs, he will match each dollar they put towards education, no more iphones, 1 hour screen time on family devices in common areas that is monitored by mom and dad, volunteer once a month.**

**TOP COMMENT**

**Kremla_Co**

>Your brother did the right thing and actually I wouldn't have even paid for anything. Since they're so much better (imagine talking all that shit and getting Cs) how about they pull themselves up by their bootstraps and ""work hard"" like they claim.

>You don't get to bum off your parents and feel like you're superior sorry this is real life not fucking 4chan.

I'd say around half the people here think double eyelids are more attractive, and half the people here think monolids are more attractive. 

But when I asked my non-asian friends, a lot of them said they didn't even register the difference until now. That shocked me because here, a lot of people will absolutely mention whether someone as double lids or monolids when describing what someone looks like. They'll even mention it when describing what type they're usually attracted to. So the fact that my non-asian friends didn't register a huge difference was surprising.

Whenever I see guys talk about girls they like, u hardly see them mention black girls. Unless it’s like Megan thee stallion. Like they need to look a certain way/have 1 body type to be accepted and even then it’s just objectification. Most favoured female celebrities are non-black, primarily with Eurocentric features.

The microaggression they receive, from having their natural hair mocked, to being masculinised, to being seen as undesirable, is just weird as fvck. It’s particularly strange because this negative bias comes from both non-black **and** other black people.

I know a few of these girls in my school and they’re soo pretty like. I absolutely love their hair and features.

Were a very multicultural society, and I believe that makes us what we are, there's no denying immigration is changing the nation, for better, and sadly sometimes for the worse, you can't go a day without seeing something bad has happened, either on the main stream media or social media.

With immigration brings different religions, and cultures. And these have made us thrive over the years. 

After the horrific attack at Manchester (my home city) I was walking through the City a couple of days later and there was a Iman who was sat there, and and welcomed people to come and talk to him and ask questions about Islam, which I thought was incredibly brave of him to do so, given what's just happened, and the anger us Mancunians had at the time.

I spent 45 minutes with the man, he answered the vast majority of my questions, but the ones he couldn't answer well left me wanting more information, it sent me down a rabbit hole of curiosity, it lead to me asking questions to my Asian friends and co workers, and reading paragraphs of the Qur'an online

They were likley quite hard questions to answer in all fairness, but I'm curious by nature.

Why is there so much Islamic Terrorism?

Why is deemed ok under Sharia Law to take a child bride, when it's against the actual law?

Do Muslims want even Sharia law?

It's well documented and factual that there are, and has been, hate speeches up and down the country, sometimes openly out public, why haven't these been shut down and called out the Islamic community?

Then later, I had even more questions after I read paragraphs and quotes from the Qur'an (which is an incredibly well written book, for those that haven't read it, it's well worth browse)

Now I get these questions make people uncomfortable, and to some even asking these questions is deemed hateful, but why? If you have genuine concerns about something, why not ask about it?","['hate speech', 'Muslims']"

I recently got into a nice university, and it has only been two/three weeks since it started, but my life is already hell. I know that a lot of people have trouble with roommates, but my roommate \[F19\] is pure hell

She eats my food, uses my blankets, takes stuff I need, like a pen drive or some dongles I had. Those aren't the problem since I barely use them. But my real problem is food. My mom specifically bought me a small car fridge so I could keep food in there without anyone taking it. And it actually even has a little lock on it. My roommate, being the roommate of hell, has gone as far as picking the lock to eat my food and then retorting, saying she thought it was for both of us, even though I clearly have stated all food in there is specifically for me. I even spend more money \[I am already a broke college student working a job lol\] to buy food that tastes good or is good for me, since I like eating good food.

My roommate barely makes food on her own, and she either orders out or steals food. I recently got into asian food, and I love it. I try and make it home to the best of my abilities, but obviously it isn't as good as the restaurants. But every time I buy some from a local restaurant or meal prep any food at all, more than 75% is gone.

I've even gone as far as making two boxes of food, one specifically labeled with my roommate's name. She then eats hers and most of mine. And this bothers me since I often come back tired from the gym or work or a bunch of classes to find that most of my food is gone. And I do spend a bunch of time making them, so I am furious at her.

Now here's the part I think I am the asshole, I made some pad thai yesterday morning for today, and then I immediately left. My roommate, though, stayed there for most of the day since most of her classes don't have mandatory attendance. And throughout the day, I got like 50 angry messages from her, but I didn't even notice them since I put my phone on silent and in my bag. When I come back to the dorm, I see her gone. I thought she left for her friend's place since they meet almost every day.

Later, I found out that she had an allergic reaction and had to go to the ER. Turns out... She is allergic to peanuts, and I didn't even know. And I drizzled peanut oil on it and put a bunch of chopped peanuts and nuts, all of it. And I didn't make her some since I didn't have time yesterday.

Now she has been yelling at me for putting peanuts in my food, something I would eat. Like she messaged me this "" I csn't believe you did this to me. I had to pay money for something I don't have \[she has more than enough\]"" and the text goes on and on and on.

She has been telling all her friends to dm me and tell me I am a monster. For making something in my own food. I am confused here because she ate my food when she's not supposed to but I did make her have a allergic reaction.

AITAH?

edit: I am sorry to anyone and everyone I keep offending by being a doormat or something.

edit 2. The RA is back! I told him and everyone above him and all. I will be getting a new roommate. She will stay with me for like another week. Until then, I will be cooking with peanuts all the time and labeling everything i make as "" Has peanuts"". And also I am a guy. Yeah, my university groups guys with girls. I don't know why like 20 of you said this doesn't exist because of me being a guy. Oh, and also... I changed it back to it's normal spelling but for some reason I can't change the title. And yeah, I might be a doormat and be an asshole to myself but i feel that's better than to be one to others. Also she apparently told me there are foods that smell like peanuts but aren't. I have no idea if she is telling the truth... I don't think so. And the photo of her face full of hives, and rashes, and all. it's pretty funny. SHe looks like a cartoon character right now. And I didn't say this but she is putting on a huuuge amount of makeup to cover it, but that isn't helping and she currently completely out of it. She tried putting on very light lipstick to cover it up but that sorta broke. But I am happy now. She looks like a witch and for the remaining one week we have together, it's gonna be fun. I am no longer cooking meals for her and and putting peanuts in everything. also labeling just in case.",[]

I'll never admit this out loud to anyone in my real life, but I do regret marrying someone from a different culture and ethnicity. I feel ashamed even writing that, but it's the truth.

The hardest part is his own self-hatred. Over time, l've realized he didn't really choose me because of who l am, but because I'm white.
He has said many times that he'd never marry someone of his own ethnicity. I was only 21 when we met, and I didn't fully understand what that meant.

Having kids changed everything.
There's no romance anymore. Sex maybe once every two months, and I can feel that he's forcing himself.
His energy and attention all go to our kids. No gifts, no surprises - he even forgot my birthday this year. Maybe that isn't cultural, but l do feel like in his country being ""the devoted father"" is almost glorified, like that's the whole identity of a man after having kids.

And then there are his parents. If I started writing about how condescending, toxic, and controlling they became after the baby, it would take hours. They are obsessed with our children. Some of it is cultural, some of it is just them being awful people. They pressure him constantly. I overheard his mom saying at least 20 times how ""his eyes are too small, thank god now her grandkids have beautiful eyes just like her."" It made me sick.

I don't regret him as the father of my kids. He is wonderful with them, even if he's anxious about the smallest things. He does his best and I still love him. But the cultural differences, his obsession with race, and his self-hatred weigh so heavily on me. I love our children more than anything, but sometimes I feel sad for them because of the way he talks.

One time, I don't even know how the topic came up, I said something like ""people might see our kids as Asian"" and he replied, ""yes, and you know that for most people here looking Asian IS a bad thing, it's not something to be proud of."" That crushed me. It stuck in my head for days, and I couldn't stop thinking about it when I looked at my kids.
I've never seen them like that, never thought of them that way — the thought alone tortured me.

On the outside, we look like a beautiful family: bilingual, two cultures, good jobs, a stable life.

But inside, l'm not happy anymore.
His issues are dragging me down.
I've lost confidence. I’ve stopped trying to comfort him, it’s a lost cause. It’s never good enough, it’s never perfect enough, he will never be satisfied. Only our kids bring me joy and keep me going and I’ll do my best to make them happy.",[]

Since the beginning of time itself, religions have used different tactics to stop people from scrutinizing them. All of the major world religions are no exception but the term ""islamophobia"" genuinely pisses me off on a unique level. The fact that its become a normal thing to treat any criticisms of the religion as being purely fueled by hatred and bigotry is laughable at best. Now of course there are the people who are actually bigoted, theres the wonderful stat that in 2015 30% of people said they were in favor of bombing Agrabah (the city from Alladin) which is just... still halarious to this day I love it, and 50% of americans were against ""arabic numerals"" (the numbers 0 - 9 that are used by everyone in the country) being taught in school. But the thing is that these arent the people who are called islamophobes no, the people this term are used on are consistently just people who have genuine criticisms of the practices. Anyone who thinks that the control on hijabs isnt good, or dares point out the injustices it blatantly promotes, or the injustices its followers comite in its name consistently, or even just refuses to follow the practices of a religion they arent a part of. These are the people who are called ""islamophobes"".

When you call Israelis ""European colonizers,"" you are saying that Jews that they aren't really from Israel. That means you deny the heritage of all Jewish people, not just Israelis.

Jews are from Israel. Their culture originated there. Actual colonizers displaced them, and they were forced to wander as oppressed, stateless people for thousands of years. All that time, they kept their identity as a people from Israel, along with their religion, language, etc. They prayed about Israel every single day. The places they moved to continued to oppress them for being foreigners from Israel. Jews mainly intermarried each other. The average Russian Jew is only 5% Russian genetically and has been displaced from Russia by now because Russians never considered his family Russian. Same with Iraqi Jews, Egyptian Jews, German Jews, etc.

Jews are not liars pretending to be from Israel. They did not get a silly idea to make believe they were from Israel because they thought it was cute. If you told a Native American that they were lying about being from their homeland, they would rightly consider you a crazy racist person.

You might claim you are simply making a political argument to help Palestinians, but you are not. You are saying that all Jews around the world are lying about their ethnicity. Half the Jews in the world don't live in Israel, and you are denying their heritage too. You are targeting all Jews, not just Israelis, when you say this stuff, so it's obvious you aren't against simply the Israeli government, or even the Israeli people — you are against Jews.

And don't pretend that Jewish indigenousness doesn't count because Jews were displaced for thousands of years. Again, Native Americans were displaced for centuries, and you don't tell them that they are really white people pretending to be Native Americans. What other indigenous group have you called ""colonizers"" for returning to their homeland? None. Ever.

Same goes for the ""look, I found a Zionist in the 1800s who used the word ""colonization"" thing. If I found a Native American who used the word ""colonization"" in the 1800s, would you believe that Native Americans are all faking being from America? Obviously not. You would disagree with their wording.

If you want to not be an antisemite, then ask yourself ""Would I be a racist piece of garbage if I said this about Native Americans?"" If the answer is yes, then guess what: you are still a racist piece of garbage when you say it about Jews.

If you think indigenousness shouldn't matter when it comes to who controls land today, that's fine. Just say that. Don't pretend indigenous people are lying about their ethnicity to serve your political interests. If you can't stand on your actual opinions, and you depends on racist narratives instead, then take a look in the mirror.",['Jews']

Throwaway bc my roommates know my main account. So, I (23M) live in a college apartment with 2 roommates, both of which are women, and one of them is Muslim (let's call her sana). We all get along pretty well and have lived together for over a year with no issues. 

Yesterday, Sana told us her mom was visiting for the upcoming weekend. For info, her mom is very conservative and religious, and apparently doesn’t approve of her daughter living with male roommates (Awkward because I exist). As a result, Sana asked if I could leave the apartment entirely for the day her mom was visiting. Like, be out the whole day and even find somewhere else to sleep overnight.

I told her I wasn’t comfortable with that bc I had a major assignment due, and I focus best when I’m working from home. I also didn’t wanna have to pack up all my stuff and go stay somewhere else just to keep up an appearance for someone I don’t even know. Additionally, I pay equal rent and felt like I had a right to be in the apartment.

Still, to try and compromise, I offered to stay in my room the entire day and be quiet/ not come out at all on the condition that I’d at least be allowed to quickly come out to make lunch or dinner, or they could just bring food to my room so I wouldn’t starve. I genuinely thought that was fair and respectful.

But no, sana wasn’t happy with that and insisted I should be out of the apartment entirely. She said her mom would “freak out” if she found out a guy lived there and it would cause a lot of drama in her family. I said while I understood her position, I wasn't going to dip from my own home, especially with a big deadline hanging over me.

She's still pissed and being pretty cold toward me now and also vented to our other roommate, who stayed neutral and said she saw both sides.

I really wasn’t trying to be difficult or disrespectful. I understand her cultural situation, but I also feel like it’s unfair to expect someone to completely vacate their home just to accommodate someone else’s family’s beliefs especially when I tried to find a middle ground.

So, AITA? 

Edit: Sana never chose to have male roommates, but it just so happened that she was practically bullied out of her old apartment (all female) for a conflict involving another girl and this was her last resort. Also, I'm so disheartened to see so much hate in the comments and it's enlightened me to be kinder and more understanding to sana and her situation. This was never meant to start a debate in the comments and I urge everyone to have more empathy and humanity. 

I will also be going home and asking a friend if I can stay over for a day. For everyone concerned about how if I let it by pass now, that it will happen again and again, I will speak to sana about this properly and urge her to talk to her mom. Thank you for all the level headed and empathetic comments I did get that helped me understand her perspective better, as I do care for her greatly and never want to hurt her if I can help it. One day isn't the end of the world and if it helps her, I've realised Id be happy to do it",[]

My boyfriend (22m) and I (22f) have been together for 3 years. We were high school friends, grew apart, ended up going to the same college, similar majors, reconnected, you can guess the rest. 

We've been on the rocks lately. Our lifestyles just don't align very well, and sometimes he treats me more like a mother than a partner. I am losing patience.

He is an only child, and kind of a massive momma's boy. His mom is nice enough, just very traditional. Until recently, I don't feel like I've had a reason to distrust her. He confides in her a lot about our relationship, sometimes an uncomfortable amount. For the past couple of months, I feel like she's been trying to plant seeds in my head about having kids when I'm alone with her.
Some examples:
""The joy of motherhood is like nothing else. You'll understand someday."" 

""I know it's hard right now. You know, a baby might bring you closer."" 

""My husband and I fought constantly until we finally had [bf's name]."" 

""Once you have a baby, everything else falls away. They're little miracle workers.""

""You know, fatherhood changes people. I think [bf's name] just needs to experience it."" (that last one in regards to his irresponsibility and lack of accountability for housework)

I'm on the pill. I've been trying to get on a different form of birth control that doesn't require constant effort (like an IUD, injections, arm implant) but I haven't been able to decide which one is right for me. My birth control comes in a blister pack, but I usually pop a week's worth into a pill organizer so I can just take it with my other medications. I don't bother taking the sugar pills you're supposed to take during the week of your period.

I keep the empty blister packs with the leftover sugar pills in my nightstand because I'm weird about throwing things away sometimes (""what if I need it later"" mentality I picked up from growing up in a doomsday prepping household. thanks dad). I feel incredibly stupid for that now.

A couple of weeks ago, I missed my period. Took a pregnancy test, saw the dreaded second line, and proceeded to freak out. BF was at work when I found out, so I called him immediately. I told him we needed to talk, and that it was urgent. He didn't want to come home at first since we are not in a great situation financially. I started bawling and begging, and I think he realized I was serious.

When he got home, I was sitting on the bathroom floor. I was a wreck, cried so hard I vomited. Anyways, BF gets back to our apartment, finds me on the floor, and as soon as he sees the pregnancy test, he fucking smiles. His face lit up, and I saw red. No acknowledgement of the state I was in. The first thing he said to me besides, ""what's going on??"" was, ""oh my god, baby, this is great!"" I wanted to put my head through the wall. 

I tried to explain to him through snot and tears and spit that no, this was not great, we're both full time students with jobs. I can't take time off. I have a ton of unresolved health issues. We can barely afford the roof over our heads. I hate the idea of getting an abortion. I am all for it when it's someone else, just for me, I don't know if I can bring myself to do it.

He left me to cool down in the bathroom for a while (I told him to get out) and I saw one of my fucking blister packs in the bathroom trash can. We don't use it very often, so we only empty it once in a while. I threw away the pregnancy test, it knocked aside a wad of toilet paper, and the silver foil caught my eye. I dug through the trash and I found 7 of my regular fucking birth control pills at the bottom of the trash bag. I can't believe he not only did this to me but also was so incredibly careless. It's like he barely tried to hide it. I can't tell if he wanted me to find out or if he just genuinely doesn't have anything knocking around inside his cranium besides a few rocks.

I had been wracking my brain trying to figure out how this could've happened. I am so, so diligent about taking my meds. I feel so fucking stupid. So so so stupid. The sugar pills are literally a different fucking color. I take like 7 pills in the morning and unceremoniously dump them into my mouth, I definitely didn't look closely at them. He didn't give me a reason to think I had to. He hadn't said anything about kids. I could tell he was kind of trying to be better about his responsibilities lately, I thought things were finally starting to look up when it came to the state of our relationship.

We have access to each other's phones. I think he probably checked my fitbit app to find out when I was ovulating, since I track my period there. I don't know how else he could've known. I think I remember a few times I'd unlock my phone and find the app open, but I thought nothing of it. 

I confided in a few close friends about all of this. Told them everything. What he did, how I think he did it, how I think his mom might've told him to, how fucking devastated I am and how stupid I feel. In essence, they told me I need to grow a spine, leave him, stop going crazy, and figure my shit out/decide what to do. Now a part of me feel like i migjt be overreacting. Im staying with my parents right now, they don't know what's going on. They're kind of religious, and I'm not exactly sure how they feel about abortion. I don't want to bring it up because I don't know how they'll react. BF has been texting me nonstop, telling me to calm down and come home and talk to him. I'm so fucking lost. Sorry if this is a mess. I'm not proofreading, I don't have the bandwidth right now.

Quick edit:
I'm terminating. I'm chronically ill, I'd have an extremely risky pregnancy, and I don't want to bring a kid into this environment. I've made an appointment, but I'm still so scared. I also had my friend gently prod my ex over text about what happened, and he didn't even have to do much. He bent immediately, saying he needed to get it off his chest and that he ""feels like a terrible person"" (he is). I am leaving that goddamn scumbag scourge on my life far behind me, he just doesn't know it yet.",[]

*Typo in the title, should be ""isn't Going to Take It Anymore""*

##Background

Asmongold is a hugely popular Twitch and YouTube personality who built his brand on blunt commentary and reaction content, but over time his takes have grown more openly inflammatory. He’s been criticized for racist remarks, culture-war talking points, and for defending figures like Elon Musk, which many see as part of a broader drift further right in his politics. His subreddit, /r/Asmongold, reflects that shift: a mix of devoted fans, increasingly reactionary views, and drama over whether his community has become a pipeline for culture-war grievances.

##Context

Asmongold posted a video yesterday in the aftermath of the Charlie Kirk assassination in which he says 90% of political violence is from the left, who continue to terrorize people daily, and that until violence happens to them, it isn't going to stop. That they ""reap what they sow.""

Here is a transcribed portion of his video

> Right-wing people are not going to continue to turn the other cheek. They're not going to continue to.. just.. 'Oh well this is just another crazy left-wing radical' - I think you're probably going to see right-wing people doing the same thing to left-wing people. And, honestly, while I don't see this as a good thing, I certainly don't feel that sorry for them.
> 
> Because a lot of left-wing people have no problem advocating for violence. Or, at least, using coded language in order to advocate for violence. The fact of the matter is, there's a certain level of intellectual dishonesty that goes on in situations like this where it's considered 'Oh, well this isn't actually what they meant', or 'No, this is actually some other..' No it is: It's exactly what they mean. They're trying to advocate for killing people that they disagree with. That's what's happening and there's no talking around it. And to the extent if you try to, you're insulting the intelligence of anyone you're speaking to.
> 
> And I think that now what you're going to see is a lot of right-wing people end up doing this to left-wing people now even more. Because, it's very clear that, these social media platforms are not going to moderate this behavior. The FBI, for whatever reason, just refuses to deal with, or have any degree of accountability for dealing with these obvious terrorists that are in the country. And because of that, you're going to start seeing an uptick in violence from right-wing people as well. And this is going to be, in my opinion, I don't think the word for it is 'justified,' because it's not justified, but the word is 'expected.' I think it's going to be expected. The fact is, again, you bring a knife to a gun fight, you're going to lose. And don't be surprised if you bring guns to gunfights and somebody starts to decide to start shooting back.

This video is posted to his subreddit: [Asmon Just Posted on his channel](https://www.reddit.com/r/Asmongold/comments/1ndsogd/asmon_just_posted_on_his_channel/), and the reaction is pretty mixed, there's a lot of die-hard support, but also dozens of people pushing back against the 90% and ""left vs right"" narrative.

Mods deleted a lot of the really bad stuff, but there's still a lot left to highlight.

>> His ""90%"" statistic that he pulled out of his ass is pure revisionist history, however. Everything shows that the majority of politically motivated killings or attempted killing in the US over the last decade is majority right-wing in origin. But Asmon doesn't read studies, he largely goes off of vibes and what social media algorithms show him.

Since Europe was mentioned in the last abstract I can tell you that for instance in Germany, not long ago anti LGBTQ or anti semitic violence done by both muslims or radical leftists (in the case of anti semitism) were counted as ""right wing crime"" - implying neo nazis - due to the target and not the perpetrator. I think they dont do that anymore though. In Germany also an official data request came back showing that the right wing AFD had the highest amount of violent attacks against them where the police found the perpetrators to be definitly left wing, while the Greens on 2nd place had a mix of perpetrators. Yet media outlets always said that the Greens were the biggest target of violence bc they recieved way more mean messages online.

Let me get this out of the way first: Assassination is wrong. Political violence is a cancer, and it's a tragedy for his family that they lost a father and a husband in such a brutal way.
BUT.

I am getting so frustrated seeing fellow Filipinos rush to defend this man and mourn him as some kind of martyr. The only connection most of us have to him is a shared Christian faith, and that is not enough.

Being a Christian is not a get-out-of-jail-free card for being a terrible person. His entire public platform was built on spreading division, hate, and harmful rhetoric against minorities, women, and other vulnerable groups. He added fuel to a fire that is tearing a country apart.

• ""But he's a Christian!"" So were the slave owners. So were the people who ran the Inquisition. Jesus's harshest words were for the hypocrites within his own faith. Our loyalty should be to the principles of love and justice, not to anyone who just wears the same religious label.

• ""But he has a family!"" So did many of the most harmful figures in history. Having a family is a biological fact; it is not a certificate of good character. We can feel sympathy for his family's personal loss while still holding him accountable for the public harm he caused.

We need to be more discerning. Blindly defending someone just because they're on ""our team"" is the very tribalism that he himself promoted. It's okay to condemn his murder while also refusing to whitewash his legacy.


TL;DR: The activist was a harmful public figure. Filipinos defending him just because he's a Christian with a family are ignoring the immense damage he did. Murder is wrong, but so is defending hate.",[]

[**child support is unconstitutional**](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladviceofftopic/comments/wai36a/child_support_is_unconstitutional/) \- July 28, 2022

It is a financial legal obligation from a court where no crime has been committed. It is a debtors prison for all intents and purposes.

Child support orders create situations in which it is illegal to be poor. Unemployment welfare pays some men ""not to work,"" while for single fathers It can be made a crime ""not to work.""

This is an abomination in our legal system.

**Top comment:**

\*sigh

This comes up about twice a week by people who think it's okay to have sex and create a child and be free from the consequences of that act.

Child support is not a ""punishment"" so the fact that you mentioned ""crime"" is irrelevant. It is an OBLIGATION TO THE CHILD. That is it. You helped created a child, you have an obligation TO THE CHILD to help pay for its upbringing.

>Unemployment welfare pays some men ""not to work,"" while for single fathers It can be made a crime ""not to work.""

You clearly have an agenda you want to push, but the facts kinda make your claims irrelevant. IRL, the vast majority of people on government-assistance work 2 (or more) jobs to eek out a living in addition to the government assistance.

**OOP's heavily downvoted response:**

There IS NO LEGAL BASIS FOR DECLARING AN ARBITRARY FINANCIAL OBLIGATION TO A CHILD.

**Explanation:**

You seem to be confused about how states' authority works. The constitution says what the federal government is and is not allowed to do in general terms, and it says a few things that states aren't allowed to do. And then states get to do more or less anything else.

So to say ""there's no legal basis"" when states have decided to do it, you'd need to find something specific that prohibits it. You haven't done that. You've just whined a lot.

**OOP:**

Than why is child support federally enforced? If states have fiat jurisdiction than why can I not move to another state and avoid paying a child support order?

Bush Senior made this a federal issue fully under the limits of the U.S. constitution.

**Response:**

It's enforced at the state level the vast majority of the time. However, the federal government has an interest in making sure that citizens cannot avoid a debt merely by moving states. I would guess that the Child Support Recovery Act is authorized under the Commerce Clause, but I haven't looked.

**OOP:**

It is last I checked, so children are commercial products regulated under interstate commerce? Child support as a ""debt"" where evasion is a crime is a debtors prison. If they made it a ""tax,"" it would be constitutional; but then the IRS would be involved in custody disputes.

**Other OOP Gems:**

Nowhere in our bill of rights or constitution does it state that children have a right to their parents money.

**Response:**

[What else are you spending it on, a father of the year mug?](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestoflegaladvice/comments/waosm7/what_else_are_you_spending_it_on_a_father_of_the/) \- also the title of the r/bestoflegaladvice thread

**OOP:**

Loans are voluntary. The constitutionality I referred to only involve debts that aren't agreed to; debts that are ""forced"" on you, such as child support. A credit card or loan is contractual, and therefore does not count.

Therefore implying that sex with a woman is a legally binding financial contract if she gets pregnant is to also say that all women are prostitutes. I hate people that claim sex is financial by its very nature.

**Response:**

Since men can and do receive child support as well, it means you're a prostitute too.

**OOP:**

Men who receive child support are worse than prostitutes.

**OOP, elsewhere:**

If the state enforces the debt under penalty of jail, it is a debt to the state. That's simple logic, no tricks. It doesn't matter where the money is ""supposed"" to go; it is a debt to the state handed to a woman.

I don't need a citation that child support is an arbitrary nominal amount. That's exactly what it is; ""from father according to ability, to child according to need.""

It's actually communist marxism, dressed up and hidden using male-female relationships.

**And more:**

No, fathering a child does not financially obligate me legally. This is one reason the 19th amendment was a mistake.

**And more:**

I protested my ability to fight for custody in court as a religious objection, stating that fighting for custody is against my religion. So if I am morally prohibited from fighting for custody or even visitation, what reasoning is there to deny me even visiting hours and then extract child support from me?

I haven't seen my kid in 4 years. (Editor's note: this led to a long thread of more ""interesting"" legal opinions from OOP, leading to...)

King Solomon was ready to execute a child to resolve a custody dispute.

**Response:**

Yes.

Which is not a prohibition on fighting for custody of your children.

**OOP:**

How can you possibly not interpret that as a prohibition on fighting for custody?

[\*\* Let me get this straight... if a wife cheats on her husband.... \*\*](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladviceofftopic/comments/wba3vc/let_me_get_this_straight_if_a_wife_cheats_on_her/) \- July 29, 2022 (the next day)

And gets pregnant, and her husband forgives her and is willing to raise the child as his own; the biological father can show up years later and fight for custody? The stepfather of the bastard child can have his wife go after the biological father for child support?

And this is not only allowed, but encouraged?

**Explanation for why they started a new post:**

They only deleted my last thread when I showed child support to be directly in line with Marxist communist theory. (OOP clearly does not understand the difference between deleted and locked)

**Comments:**

Just because you don't like answers doesn't make it unconstitutional.

""The whole subject of the domestic relations of husband and wife, parent and child, belongs to the laws of the states, and not to the laws of the United States."" [In re Burris](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/136/586/)

States, thus, are empowered to decide how to handle child custody issues, so long as they meet Constitutional requirements around due process. A family court where you can attend a hearing, have a lawyer, and state your case, therefore, is a constitutionally appropriate method.

As u/derspiny noted, in your hypothetical, the court would take the facts of the case and state law and make a determination in the best interest of the child. Important facts, for example, would be the child's age, whether the biological father had any idea that they had a kid, whether the husband plans to remain married to the wife, the child's desires (moreso as the child ages, especially if the child is a teenager). It's a balancing act, but the basic principle is that a child deserves to be supported by and have a relationship with both parents, so long as it is feasible, reasonable, and safe.

**OOP:**

They don't give you a lawyer. I was never accused of a crime.

**Response:**

I didn't say that they give you a lawyer. You **can** have one, however.

**More gems:**

So in ten years I can destroy my ex-fiances marraige.

I hate this country.

**Response:**

I mean you could blow it up now if you wanted. Court May question why you waited 10 years to file for custody or they may question how much support you actually owe.

Child support is the right of the child, not the parents.

**OOP, still angling for inverse of Father of the Year:**

Support is current and I can prove hardship as to why I waited. I'd rather get custody of the teenager than the child.

It's named after their founder, whose last name is Black. That's it.

Throwaway bc my roommates know my main account. So, I (23M) live in a college apartment with 2 roommates, both of which are women, and one of them is Muslim (let's call her sana). We all get along pretty well and have lived together for over a year with no issues. 

Yesterday, Sana told us her mom was visiting for the upcoming weekend. For info, her mom is very conservative and religious, and apparently doesn’t approve of her daughter living with male roommates (Awkward because I exist). As a result, Sana asked if I could leave the apartment entirely for the day her mom was visiting. Like, be out the whole day and even find somewhere else to sleep overnight.

I told her I wasn’t comfortable with that bc I had a major assignment due, and I focus best when I’m working from home. I also didn’t wanna have to pack up all my stuff and go stay somewhere else just to keep up an appearance for someone I don’t even know. Additionally, I pay equal rent and felt like I had a right to be in the apartment.

Still, to try and compromise, I offered to stay in my room the entire day and be quiet/ not come out at all on the condition that I’d at least be allowed to quickly come out to make lunch or dinner, or they could just bring food to my room so I wouldn’t starve. I genuinely thought that was fair and respectful.

But no, sana wasn’t happy with that and insisted I should be out of the apartment entirely. She said her mom would “freak out” if she found out a guy lived there and it would cause a lot of drama in her family. I said while I understood her position, I wasn't going to dip from my own home, especially with a big deadline hanging over me.

She's still pissed and being pretty cold toward me now and also vented to our other roommate, who stayed neutral and said she saw both sides.

I really wasn’t trying to be difficult or disrespectful. I understand her cultural situation, but I also feel like it’s unfair to expect someone to completely vacate their home just to accommodate someone else’s family’s beliefs especially when I tried to find a middle ground.

So, AITA? 

Edit: Sana never chose to have male roommates, but it just so happened that she was practically bullied out of her old apartment (all female) for a conflict involving another girl and this was her last resort. Also, I'm so disheartened to see so much hate in the comments and it's enlightened me to be kinder and more understanding to sana and her situation. This was never meant to start a debate in the comments and I urge everyone to have more empathy and humanity. 

I will also be going home and asking a friend if I can stay over for a day. For everyone concerned about how if I let it by pass now, that it will happen again and again, I will speak to sana about this properly and urge her to talk to her mom. Thank you for all the level headed and empathetic comments I did get that helped me understand her perspective better, as I do care for her greatly and never want to hurt her if I can help it. One day isn't the end of the world and if it helps her, I've realised Id be happy to do it",[]

When a Christian is homophobic, leftists waste no time chewing them out for their bigoted beliefs. But when a Muslim is homophobic, leftists have more patience and a more “whatever” attitude. 

If a Christian demanded his wife to cover up to avoiding arousing other men, leftists would be up in arms. When a Muslim does it, leftists have a “that’s just their culture” mindset. 

If a Christian banned pride flags from government buildings, they’d be chewed out for being discriminatory. When Hamtramck Michigan’s Muslim-majority council did it, leftists were silent. 

When Muslims are openly antisemitic (which many are), you hear nothing but silence from the left. 

When Muslims deny Muslim colonization (which many do), the left agrees with them. If a white European denied European colonization and said everyone loved being colonized, there would be uproar.","['Muslims', 'Christians']"

For those of who who are unaware, theres a faction of christians out there who believe that the rapture is going to happen on tuesday. My aunt is one of those people, and she has been going around, telling everybody how people will float into the sky and what not.

I'm queer, and agnostic, and while I was raised loosely christian, I haven't identified with the religion since I was in 5th grade. Most of my family on my mother's side except for my aunt are Christian, but not particularly devout, and certainly not as much as her, nor do they believe in the rapture. She apparently became very very involved in the religion at some point in college. 

Basically my entire life, I have been ridiculed by my aunt for being queer, since I came out at a young age. Most of my family was very kind, accepting and understanding, except for her. I spent every family gathering getting basically cornered, bullied, harassed, called slurs and preached at by a grown woman for my sexuality. It got to the point that my mother had to have SEVERAL sit down conversation with her to essentially tell her to quit harrassing me. This endured for a long time, and while my parents would always tell her to knock it off, she never would. 

But one day my mother seriously put her foot down against her. She made it clear that my family accepted me, and if she wouldn't tone it down, she would no longer be welcome in our home or around me

During this conversation my aunt allegedy called my family bad Christians for not sending me to conversion therapy, and that they would regret not making me repent once the 'rapture was upon us'. But, that was a few years ago, and ever since then I mostly just get sideways glances from her at family events, and the occasional bible verse text from her, which I can manage. 

I am now an adult, 19 and in college, and I was recently contacted by my aunt to meet up with her for lunch. I assumed that maybe she had a change of heart and wanted to apologize for how she treated me. This was not the case. When we met up she essentially went on a long-winded speil about how she pitys me and feels so sorry that I never repented, and how I, and the rest of my family, will be left behind because we never fully ""gave our lives to christ"".

At the end of her monologue she pulled out a stack of cash, all in 100 dollar bills, and handed it to me telling me that 'she wanted to give away her savings to those less fortunate, since she wouldn't be needing it when the rapture comes and delivers her to the lord'. I tried to talk her out of it, but she insisted, and practically forced the money into my hands, before abruptly walking away. I counted it when I got home, and it was slightly over 40k in cash.

Here's where I think I would be the ah. When the rapture inevitably doesn't happen, I have no plans of giving the money back to her. I know shes been going through some kind of long enduring religious psychosis, but I could honestly really use this type of cash to put me through college and handle other expenses, and she gave it to me willingly. 

WBITA if I didn't give her back the money when the rapture doesn't happen?

edit: my parents are now aware of this because she apparently decided to try to gift my younger sister a car (her relatively new, nice ford bronco.) i told my parents about the money, and my mother (who is also christian) told me that it would be the most ethical thing to do if i gave it back to her, and that i need to be empathetic to the struggles she's clearly going through. My dad, however, thinks that if she was stupid enough to give away her life savings on a whim, the money is better off going towards my education anyways. Im still torn.

edit/update 2: just wanted to clarify a few things:

1. i am a bisexual woman, a few people here thought i was a man
2. i have no idea why she would want to give me, of all people, the money, im just as confused as the rest of you. from what I grasped, it seemed as though it was some 'final act of kindness' towards somebody she takes great pity on? i don't know LMFAOAO

As a few of you said, I should probably leave some kind of trail to prove this was freely given and I didn't steal from her so there's no legal repercussions (should i choose to keep it, im still not sold on any course of action yet, especially because its not wendsday yet.) So I sent her an email thanking her for the gift and reiterating that I did not originally want it, but it was just OH SO very gracious of her to give money to a poor sinner like me. 

I don't want to take advantage of the mentally ill, but the selfish part of me sees this as reparations for all the torment i endured when I was younger. I've heard a few people say to invest the money instead of immediately putting it towards college, and If i keep it, that will definitely be considered. I don't expect to update again until the 'rapture'has passed, but i will update once that rolls around.

mini edit: doing my own research on the current rapture craze going on, they think the rapture will happen either tuesday 23rd or wed 24th, so i will update on thursday.


Thursday Update: 

Hi all, it's thursday, so as promised, heres the update everyone wanted, and I will make it brief.

1. No, my aunt did not get raptured
2. No, I will not be keeping the money, which i know will upset some of you
3. No, my sister did not get to keep the car (as i know some people were wondering)

Essentially, as a lot of you predicted, once the rapture didn't happen, my aunt kept moving the goalpost. it went from happening on Tuesday, to happening Wednesday ""because its still tuesday for some parts of the world"", to happening sometime this month. 

I decided not to keep the money, and its not for any of the reasons I initially thought it would be. Trying to give me money and giving my sister a car were not the only things that she did because she thought the rapture was coming. She quit her job as well, and I found out just this morning she also allegedly confessed to her husband that she was having an affair with her co-worker/fellow church goer (she works in admin for a megachurch in our area). I think the reason she was doing all of this was to 'get right with god' before the rapture? Buy her way into heaven and have no secrets laying on her chest? Idk i can't pretend to understand the logic of somebody thats a rapture-believer. And since, yknow, the rapture did not happen, her husband wants to file for divorce. 

I'm not particularly worried about her job, working for the church and all I'm pretty convinced they will take her back without a fuss because of how enshrined she was in the community, but 1. I read a lot of your comments, and I don't want to prove her right about how 'wicked' queer people and agnostics/atheists are by keeping it, and 2. she will definitely need it for her upcoming legal fees. I'm unsure if this is her ENTIRE lifesavings, but regardless, after letting my emotions cool a bit I know I wouldn't feel right to keep it. 

regardless, my mom approved of my decision, my dad was a bit disappointed but mostly because he was excited to potentially not have to spend any more money on me for college lmao.

oh, and, she has not explicitly asked for it back yet. I imagine its because everything thats gone on has her feeling defeated or just generally in a low place. but, even if she doesn't I plan on giving it back to her when I can (I'm a full time student with a part time job, i don't have a whole lot of free time, but I'll find a way to get it to her.)

yeah sorry this isn't the update i know a lot of people wanted. if anyone says they want to hear about the conversation when I give her the money, I'll make that update but if not this will likely be the last time I update this post. thank you everybody for all your advice! :3",['Christians']
